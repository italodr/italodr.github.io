          I consider myself a proactive, resolute and tireless person in continuing to learn and in
          search of continuously improvement in order to contribute with value and quality in
          everything I do, and always focused on functional solutions that respond to specific
          needs.

          Originally from Peru, Iâ€™m currently living in Barcelona where I work with Runroom as Head
          of front-end developers. I enjoy working together with researchers, designers and
          developers in the endless search of the best solutions that can bring the maximum value to
          users and turn the client's project into <i>gold</i>.
        </p>

          Continuous improvement is a need that helps me to constantly seek better solutions, not
          only for the clients with whom I work, but also, and mainly, for the working life of all
          my teammates. Analyzing and creating tools that help to automate processes, thus
          optimizing the productivity of the teams. I also love Agile methodologies, and keep focus
          in accessibility, automatization processes and web performance.
